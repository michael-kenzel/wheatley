# How to Ask a Programming Question

Before asking, debug the problem yourself.

State your problem clearly and provide all the necessary detail:
- the relevant portion of your code (formatted as a code block),
- the expected behavior,
- the actual behavior

ideally, provide a [Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example), e.g., on [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/)

## Do Not

- dump a bunch of code and expect people to guess what your problem or question might be
- post screenshots, let alone photos of your screen
- post your question into multiple channels at once
- “it doesn’t work” is not a problem description

---
* Use /code if you don't know how to format code blocks
