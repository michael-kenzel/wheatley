# Why you should use a Debugger

A debugger is not just for when there's a bug.

A debugger lets you watch your code do what it does in slow motion.

using a debugger just unlocks a completely different level of understanding of code
not using a debugger is the #1 mistake newbies make

Make the debugger integral part of your development workflow.
Ideally, running your code in the debugger should be the default.
Why bother with adding print statements, recompiling the code, and then having to start over with reproducing the bug.
What if the bug cannot easily be reproduced.
If you're already running in the debugger => no problem.
