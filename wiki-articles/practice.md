# How to Practice

Programming is a craft; the only way to get good at it is to program a lot.
Once you have learned the basics, start using your knowledge and make stuff.
Find something that piques your interest, that you'd like to do, that you feel motivated about. And do it.
Maybe it's making a game.
Maybe it's making a chat client.
Whatever it is, just go and try to make it.

It is important to be working on actual applications.
That way, you will be exposed to all aspects of software development, become familiar with all the tools involved, and gather experience with how to structure and organize code, how to design and engineer software, how to build an actually working system and—most importantly—how to not build one.
- Learn to use your debugger.
- Learn to use a build system.
- Learn to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/).
- Learn how to build a library.
- Learn how to integrate a library.
- Learn how to integrate someone else's library.
- Learn to work off of documentation.
- Learn to solve problems on your own. The real programming starts where the tutorials stop.
- Keep learning about the language you're using.
- Learn another language.

- Read about software architecture.
- You will hit obstacles: overcome them.
- You will run into things beyond your current level of understanding: that's how you learn what you still need to learn.
- Keep challenging yourself by doing things you haven't done before.

This is the way.
